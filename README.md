# psnr-ssmi-visual-evaluation

Code to display Structural Similarity (SSMI) scores and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores.
The plots show the PSNR and SSMI scores for the comparison of one image with the same image after applying a gaussian blur with different kernel sizes.

To run this project you need to install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
